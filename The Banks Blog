    <h2 class="heading">1-26-16: Some Tips on Design</h2>
    <p>On KA, I always spend quite a bit of time on my program's design. I've decided to share some of the stuff I've learned over time. Here we go!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I've said this before, but it really does help. Using  <code>textAlign(CENTER, CENTER);</code> both centers your text (which improves the design), and makes it easier to code. Instead of dragging the x position until you get what you want, you can just use <code>width/2</code>!</li>
        <li>Use a consistent color scheme. Try picking out one or two colors along with either black or white, and try to use just those colors for the majority of the program. For example, in <i>Solid</i>, I only used blue and white. Just throwing together a bunch of really bright colors won't look very good.</li>
        <li>Use transparency to spice things up. What I mean by this is putting a drop shadow or a transparent triangle on half of a square makes it look better than just a square. For example, in <i>Mega Mine</i>, Thunder did a good job of adding little shadows to the dirt blocks. This might not seem to do much, but it's often the details that make a game better than the rest.</li>
        <li>Spend some time making a neat background. People usually do enjoy a cool background more than just <code>background(0);</code>. If you don't have time to make a cool background, ask around KA. There's users who like to do that sort of thing (you could start with KingKhan007, AlexT, myself, or Blaze). A good example of doing this would be in the game</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Hope this article helps!</p>

    <h2 class="heading">1-26-16: <b>Saturday Scoop:</b> A Little Bit About Everland</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have heard about a game I'm making called Everland. Today I'll tell some more about it. Basically, it's a game that combines the worlds of five books/movies - Lord of the Rings, Narnia, DC, Marvel, and Star Wars.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the game is to collect the five Kingdom Crystals before time runs out. Your 'train station' in between worlds is The Wood Between the Worlds (Narnia). From there, you can click one of the ponds to go to one of the worlds.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, there's minigames and missions you can complete for money, which you can buy armor and things with. You'll also battle some lesser villains (Saruman, Miraz, Loki, The Riddler, Count Dooku) to prepare for the big battles with the worst villains (Sauron, the White Witch, Ultron, The Joker, and Darth Sidious).
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do you get the Kingdom Crystals? Once you've cleared a world from villains, and completed all of the missions, you get the Kingdom Crystal for that world.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to help with this game, right now it's in the planning stage. So give me all your ideas! Also, if there's any Marvel or DC lovers out there, you could inform me (since the only superhero movie I've seen is The Avengers).
    
    <h2 class="heading">1-26-16: Introducing This Blog</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been thinking about making a blog for quite a while now. Peter Collingridge, Blaze, Aidabaida, and a few others have all made really cool blogs so I thought I might give it a shot. Here's some stuff you'll see on this blog:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><i>"The Saturday Scoop"</i>: Each Saturday, I'll give you some inside info about one or two of my projects I'm working on.</li>
        <li><i>"Helpful Hints"</i>: These kind of posts will tell you about some helpful coding things I have figured out and think might help others. It might also have some 'How To's.</li>
        <li><i>"Random Reviews"</i>: I'll be reviewing some programs, they will be under this category.</li>
        <li><i>Everything Else</i>: Everything (like this post) falls into this catergory.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you want to be notified whenever a new post comes out, then just post a single period/dot under the "Subscribe Here" post.</p>
