                <h2 id = "1" class = "post-title">1 | Coming Up With The Idea</h2>
    <p class="post-content"><b>ORIGINAL IDEAS</b>.<br>Original ideas are the hardest to come up with, but are usually the most satisfying. I can't really tell you how to come up with an original idea that well, because it usually just comes to you bit by bit after being inspired by other things.<br><br> Another thing you could do is what I call the <b>plus method</b>. Take two games (online, video, or real life) and see what they would be like together. So, like, what would Geometry Dash + Minecraft make? A geometry dash game with minecraft features, like building and destroying blocks? How about Hide and Seek + Plants vs Zombies? Would you have to find the zombies hiding in your house, and then destroy them with your plants?<br><br> You could also try the <b>setting switch</b>, where you take a game and think about what it would be like in another place/time period/style. Like Agar.io in the Star Wars universe, Duck Life in the Wild West, or Jetpack Joyride underwater.<br><br>Now, the plus method and the setting switch won't be completely original, but if you make it different enough from the original, it'll at least be a bit more yours than just a replication.
    Even though taking a popular game and recreating it on KA is usually much easier than trying to think of an original idea, it can still be a bit difficult to find a video game not way too hard to make, but still fun to play.<br><br><br><b>VIDEO GAME REPLICATIONS.</b><br>
    If I'm getting desperate and can't think of any ideas, some online places I go to find games to replicate or get inspired are Ketchapp (I love Ketchapp games), Coolmath/Coolified Games, Armor Games, or of course, the App Store (or Google Play).
    
    <br><br><br><b>REAL LIFE REPLICATIONS.</b><br>
    
    Real life has plenty of game inspiration, from board games to card games to active games to word games to sports. You could recreate Battleship, Tic Tac Toe, hockey, capture the flag, Settlers of Catan, kick the can, foosball, Uno, hide and seek, bowling, Yahtzee, freeze tag, and the list could go on and on.<br><br>Even things that aren't games in real life can be turned into one with programming. You could turn playing a guitar, blowing bubbles, brushing your teeth, eating a taco, programming, writing a letter, roasting a marshmallow, school, washing dishes, earning money, or even getting sick into a game!</p>

                <h2 id="2" class = "post-title">2 | Pro Planning</h2>
                <p class = "post-content">Once you've settled on a game you're going to make (or at least have something that resembles an idea), you'll probably want to do a little planning. How much planning you do is up to you - for some people, plotting out your game could drain your inspiration, but for others it could make you even more excited to make it.<br><br>When I plan out my games, I usually do so on a Google Doc, Word document, Pages, etc. The first thing I write down is the name of my game. If you haven't decided on a name yet, you can just put "Untitled" or "Unnamed [game type] game". Next, put down a small description of your game - something like this would work - "A game in which you play a pirate ship, exploring an ocean from a bird's eye view, trying to brave storms, defeat other pirates, raid boats, and reach the Seven Keys of the Seven Seas - all while keeping your crew above 0".
                    <br><br>
                    Now that you've gotten the basics written down, try sketching out the [important] scenes down on paper. Just make a square for the canvas, and then draw what you imagine your game will look like.
                    <br><br>
                    Next, make a section on your document called "Ideas". This is where you'll write down every cool idea that comes to you for your game on a list. You probably won't be able to do all of them, but it helps get your creative juices flowing.
