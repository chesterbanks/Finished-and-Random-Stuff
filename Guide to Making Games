                <h2 id = "1" class = "post-title">1 | Coming Up With The Idea</h2>
    <p class="post-content"><b>ORIGINAL IDEAS</b>.<br>Original ideas are the hardest to come up with, but are usually the most satisfying. I can't really tell you how to come up with an original idea that well, because it usually just comes to you bit by bit after being inspired by other things.<br><br> Another thing you could do is what I call the <b>plus method</b>. Take two games (online, video, or real life) and see what they would be like together. So, like, what would Geometry Dash + Minecraft make? A geometry dash game with minecraft features, like building and destroying blocks? How about Hide and Seek + Plants vs Zombies? Would you have to find the zombies hiding in your house, and then destroy them with your plants?<br><br> You could also try the <b>setting switch</b>, where you take a game and think about what it would be like in another place/time period/style. Like Agar.io in the Star Wars universe, Duck Life in the Wild West, or Jetpack Joyride underwater.<br><br>Now, the plus method and the setting switch won't be completely original, but if you make it different enough from the original, it'll at least be a bit more yours than just a replication.
    Even though taking a popular game and recreating it on KA is usually much easier than trying to think of an original idea, it can still be a bit difficult to find a video game not way too hard to make, but still fun to play.<br><br><br><b>VIDEO GAME REPLICATIONS.</b><br>
    If I'm getting desperate and can't think of any ideas, some online places I go to find games to replicate or get inspired are Ketchapp (I love Ketchapp games), Coolmath/Coolified Games, Armor Games, or of course, the App Store (or Google Play).
    
    <br><br><br><b>REAL LIFE REPLICATIONS.</b><br>
    
    Real life has plenty of game inspiration, from board games to card games to active games to word games to sports. You could recreate Battleship, Tic Tac Toe, hockey, capture the flag, Settlers of Catan, kick the can, foosball, Uno, hide and seek, bowling, Yahtzee, freeze tag, and the list could go on and on.<br><br>Even things that aren't games in real life can be turned into one with programming. You could turn playing a guitar, blowing bubbles, brushing your teeth, eating a taco, programming, writing a letter, roasting a marshmallow, school, washing dishes, earning money, or even getting sick into a game!</p>

                <h2 id="2" class = "post-title">2 | Pro Planning</h2>
                <p class = "post-content">Once you've settled on a game you're going to make (or at least have something that resembles an idea), you'll probably want to do a little planning. How much planning you do is up to you - for some people, plotting out your game could drain your inspiration, but for others it could make you even more excited to make it.<br><br>When I plan out my games, I usually do so on a Google Doc, Word document, Pages, etc. The first thing I write down is the name of my game. If you haven't decided on a name yet, you can just put "Untitled" or "Unnamed [game type] game". Next, put down a small description of your game - something like this would work - "A game in which you play a curious child trying to find treasure in an old museum".
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Storyline:</b> I don't know about other people, but I really enjoy games with a storyline. I would rather play a game under the premesis "Erik has been captured by his family's long time enemy, the Based Whelves, and must find his way back home to warn his family of the treacherous spies within their castle" better than "You're the square, avoid spikes and lava". If you're a good storyteller, than write down the backstory for your main character, [optional] allies, enemies, setting, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Storyboard: </b>Now that you've gotten the basics written down, try sketching out the [important] scenes down on paper. Just make a square for the canvas, and then draw what you imagine your game will look like.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Idea list: </b>Next, make a section on your document called "Ideas". This is where you'll write down every cool idea that comes to you for your game on a list. You probably won't be able to implement all of them, but it helps get your creative juices flowing.

                <h2 id="4" class = "post-title">4 | Go For the Gameplay</h2>
                <p class = "post-content">The first thing I usually do when I have a game idea is to just try to get the gameplay working. For now, just avoid the graphics, and use squares for the characters, and a plain color as the background.<br><br>Right now just work on the scene of the game where you're playing (not the menu, etc). That'll come later, in step 7.<br><br>Here's a few tips for gameplay (I don't know what type of game you're making, but maybe a few of these will help):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you have a bunch of almost-the-same things, such as falling rocks, enemies, bullets, etc, you should really use OOP (Object Oriented Programming). If you don't know how to use OOP, there's some tutorials by Pamela <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/object-oriented/p/object-types">here</a>. If those don't help you understand how to use OOP in games (it didn't really help me too much), then I would suggest looking at a simpler game that does, such as Kevin23's <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/penguin-shooter/6108821133066240">Penguin Shooter</a> game.</li>
                    <li>If you have a game that includes key movement (as most games do), there is a better way to do it than just something like this: <pre>if(keyIsPressed && keyCode === UP){
    playerY -= 5;                
}</pre>Instead of the code above, which is glitchy and you can't press multiple keys at once, use this:<pre>var keys = [];
var keyPressed = function(){ keys[keyCode] = true; };
var keyReleased = function(){ keys[keyCode] = false; };
    
draw = function(){
    if(keys[UP]){
        playerY -= 5;
    }
};
</pre>It makes it key movement so much smoother.</li>
                    <li>Using PVectors is a bit more efficient than an x and y variable. PVectors a basically pre-defined objects with the first one as <code>x:</code> and the second one as <code>y:</code>. So, instead of this code:<pre>var playerX = 0;
var playerY = 0;
                    </pre>You would do this code:<pre>var player = new PVector(0, 0);</pre>To call the x position of the player, you would do <code>player.x</code>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="5" class = "post-title">5 | Adding Graphics</h2>
                <p class = "post-content">All right, now that you've got the basic gameplay down, it's time to add the graphics - a very important part of game making. People like games that look good much more than the same game with clashing colors, mismatched fonts, and lame player and character graphics. Here's a few tips:</p>
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                <li>The first thing you'll want to add is the background. Although a plain <code>background()</code> could be okay, but a cool background is always a nice touch. You can make a background pretty cool with gradients using <code>lerpColor()</code>, like this:</li>
                <pre>
for(var i = 0; i &lt height; i += 5){
    noStroke();
    fill(lerpColor(color1, color2, i/height));
    rect(0, i, width, 5);
}
                </pre>
                    
                </ul>
